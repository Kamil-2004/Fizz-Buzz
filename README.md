# Fizz Buzz Game
A simple implementation of the classic Fizz Buzz game in Python.

# About
The Fizz Buzz game is a well-known programming exercise that prints out numbers from 1 to a target number, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "Fizz Buzz".

# Usage
To run the game, simply execute the this.py script in your terminal or command prompt. The game will print out the results up to the target number, which is currently set to 20.

# Customization
You can easily customize the target number by modifying the target variable at the top of the script.

# Logo
The script also prints out a fun ASCII art logo at the beginning of the game.
